/**
 * Write a function `f(a, b)` which takes two strings as arguments and returns a
 * string containing only the unique characters found in both strings, in the
 * order that they appeared in `a`. Remember to skip spaces and characters you
 * have already encountered!
 *
 * Example: commonCharacters('acexivou', 'aegihobu')
 * Returns: 'aeiou'
 *
 * Extra credit: Extend your function to handle more than two input strings.
