/**
 * Given an array containing a deck of cards, implement a function that shuffles
 * the deck.
 *
 * Example:
 *  var deck = orderedDeck();
 *  // ["A♥","2♥","3♥",...,"J♦","Q♦","K♦"]
 *  shuffleDeck(deck);
 *  // ["2♠","J♣","A♦", ... ,"7♣","8♣","K♠"]
 *
 * Note:
 *   A shuffled deck should be completely random. That means that a given card should
 *   be as likely as any other to appear in a given deck index, completely independent
 *   of the order of the input deck. Think carefully about how to be sure your algorithm
 *   generates a properly shuffled deck-- it is easy to accidentally create a biased algorithm.
 *
 * Extra credit:
 *   - Even a naive algorithm can easily run in linear time. However, does your
 *     algorithm remain unbiased as N (the deck size) increases? How do you know?
 *   - Once you have created a properly random, linear algorithm, what is its space complexity?
 *     There is an algorithm that uses O(N) time and O(1) space (i.e., an in-place shuffle).
 *
 * A further note on randomness:
 *   Technically, a computer-shuffled deck will usually be "pseudorandom",
 *   not "truly" random. However, the difference between the two is too small to
 *   be detectable by any known test.
 *   See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator .
 *
 *   A human shuffler is much more biased; it takes around seven normal "riffle"
 *   shuffles before a real deck is actually randomized.
 *   See https://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/Mann.pdf .
